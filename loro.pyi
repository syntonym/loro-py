        Get the cursor at the given position.

        Using "index" to denote cursor positions can be unstable, as positions may
        shift with document edits. To reliably represent a position or range within
        a document, it is more effective to leverage the unique ID of each item/character
        in a List CRDT or Text CRDT.

        Loro optimizes State metadata by not storing the IDs of deleted elements. This
        approach complicates tracking cursors since they rely on these IDs. The solution
        recalculates position by replaying relevant history to update stable positions
        accurately. To minimize the performance impact of history replay, the system
        updates cursor info to reference only the IDs of currently present elements,
        thereby reducing the need for replay.

        Get the cursor at the given position.

        Using "index" to denote cursor positions can be unstable, as positions may
        shift with document edits. To reliably represent a position or range within
        a document, it is more effective to leverage the unique ID of each item/character
        in a List CRDT or Text CRDT.

        Loro optimizes State metadata by not storing the IDs of deleted elements. This
        approach complicates tracking cursors since they rely on these IDs. The solution
        recalculates position by replaying relevant history to update stable positions
        accurately. To minimize the performance impact of history replay, the system
        updates cursor info to reference only the IDs of currently present elements,
        thereby reducing the need for replay.
